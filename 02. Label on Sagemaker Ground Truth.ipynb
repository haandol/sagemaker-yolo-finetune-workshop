    "* [Amazon SageMaker pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/)\n",
    "* [SageMaker Ground Truth pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth/pricing/)\n",

    "The standard `ml.t2.medium` instance should be sufficient to run the notebooks.\n",

    "We will use GPU-accelerated instance types for training and hyperparameter optimization, and use spot instances where appropriate to optimize these costs.\n",
    "\n",
